## Getting Started

In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

## Exploring the Data
Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time import time
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualization code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the Census dataset
data = pd.read_csv("census.csv")

# Examine if there are any missing values 
data.info()

# Success - Display the first record
display(data.head(n=1))

### Implementation: Data Exploration
A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following:
- The total number of records, `'n_records'`
- The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
- The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
- The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.

** HINT: ** You may need to look at the table above to understand how the `'income'` entries are formatted. 


```python
# TODO: Total number of records
n_records = len(data)

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000
greater_50k = data.loc[data['income'].str[0] == '>']
n_greater_50k = len(greater_50k)

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
at_most_50k = data.loc[data['income'].str[0] == '<']
n_at_most_50k = len(at_most_50k)

# TODO: Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = float(n_greater_50k*100) / n_records

# Print the results
print "Total number of records: {}".format(n_records)
print "Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k)
print "Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k)
print "Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: {:.2f}%".format(greater_percent)
```

    Total number of records: 45222
    Individuals making more than $50,000: 11208
    Individuals making at most $50,000: 34014
    Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: 24.78%


From the data exploration, we notice that the number of income no greater than 50k ( n_at_most_50k) is more than three times the number of income greater than 50k (n_greater_50k). Therefore the data is unbalanced. Some techniques to handle unbalanced data include:
* Stratification, which preserves the relative portion of samples for each class
* Using precision / recall / F1 score as performance metric, rather than accuracy.

** Featureset Exploration **

## Preparing the Data
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 

Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.


```python
# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)
```


![png](output_11_0.png)


For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.

Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 


```python
# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)
features_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_log_transformed, transformed = True)
```


![png](output_13_0.png)


### Normalizing Numerical Features
In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.

Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.


```python
# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']

features_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)
features_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))
```

### Implementation: Data Preprocessing

From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.

|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.
 - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
   - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.


```python
# TODO: One-hot encode the 'features_log_minmax_transform' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features_final = pd.get_dummies(features_log_minmax_transform)

# TODO: Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.map({'<=50K':0, '>50K':1})
# income = income_raw.apply(lambda x: 1 if x=='>50K' else 0)

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features_final.columns)
print "{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
# print encoded
display(features_final.head(n = 5))
print features_final.shape
```

    103 total features after one-hot encoding.

### Shuffle and Split Data
Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.

Run the code cell below to perform this split.


```python
# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_final, 
                                                    income, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, 
                                                    random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print "Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0])
print "Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0])
```

    Training set has 36177 samples.
    Testing set has 9045 samples.

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:

$$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$

In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 


#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall

** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).

** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`

** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`

For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).

### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.

** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.

** HINT: ** 

* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. 
* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.


```python
'''
TP = np.sum(income) # Counting the ones as this is the naive case. Note that 'income' is the 'income_raw' data 
encoded to numerical values done in the data preprocessing step.
FP = income.count() - TP # Specific to the naive case

TN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
FN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
'''
# TODO: Calculate accuracy, precision and recall
TP = np.sum(income)
FP = income.count() - TP

accuracy = TP / float(income.count())
recall = TP / TP
precision = TP / float(income.count())

print accuracy
print recall
print precision

# TODO: Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5 and correct values for precision and recall.
# HINT: The formula above can be written as (1 + beta**2) * (precision * recall) / ((beta**2 * precision) + recall)
beta = 0.5
fscore = (1 + beta**2) * (precision * recall) / ((beta**2 * precision) + recall)

# Print the results 
print "Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore)
```

    0.247843969749
    1
    0.247843969749
    Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2917]


###  Supervised Learning Models
**The following are some of the supervised learning models that are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

### Question 2 - Model Application
List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that you will test on the census data. For each model chosen

- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. 
- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?

** HINT: **

Structure your answer in the same format as above^, with 4 parts for each of the three models you pick. Please include references with your answer.

**Answer: **
    
**Decision Tree**
* Decision Tree can be used to predict house price.
* Decision Tree is interpretable. In other words, we can understand why the Decision Tree makes certain decision based on the trained Decision Tree Model. Expert opinion and preferences can be included, as well as hard data. New training example can easily be added (no need to retrain the model from scratch) [3]. Decision Tree can handle mixed type of features, both categorical and numerical (which is typical in most datasets nowadays). 
* Decision Tree is prone to overfit the data and noise data. Therefore, it is important to regularize the Decision Tree Model to prevent it from overly complex. Decision trees can perform greatly with careful tuning. Another disadvantage of decision trees is that they have axis-aligned linear decision boundaries. For instance, to separate two classes whose optimal decision boundary runs at 45 degrees to the axis, the algorithm would need a large number of axis-parallel splits which might return a suboptimal output. Other than managing overfitting by cross validation, we often use ensemble methods such as Random Forest or AdaBoost to improve the performance.
* We have 103 features. It is likely that some of the features is not as informative as others. Decision Tree has built-in feature selection mechanism. Thus, it may help reduce the dimentions of the training samples and produce a more compact model.

**Support Vector Machine**
* SVM can be applied in many real-world application such as text categorization, hand-written characger recognition and advertisement click-through prediction.
* SVM is a mathematically elegant algorithm which tries to maximize the decision boundary between the classes [4]. It is effective in high dimensional spaces and also memory efficient.
* when the number of features is much greater than the number of training samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial [1]. In pratice, SVM has many hyperparameters to tune in order to get a optimal model. SVM is less scalable when the dataset is large (which, fortunately or unfortunately, is typical nowadays). Its complexity ranges between O(n_features * n_samples ^ 2) and O(n_features * n_samples ^ 3).
* We have 103 features and 36177 training samples. The training data is high dimentional while the number of training samples is significantly large than the number of features, SVM is suitable for this training samples. Moreover, We only have two class labels and thus this is binary classification problem. SVM is good at binary classification. 

**Logistic Regression**
* Logistic regression can be used in many prediction applications such as cancer predication and stock price predication.
* Logistic Regression has low computation cost, and works well when there are noise in the data. Essentially, it assigns different weights to each feature and sums the weighted features. The sum then goes through the logistic function, which yields the final probability. It has fewer hyperparameters to tune compared with other algorithms. Another great advantage of Logistic Regression is that it fundamentally returns probabilities as outputs. In many scenarios, probabilities are more useful than pure classification.
* It may not work well on non-linear problem. But with certain transformations being applied to the data, Logistic regression can handle non-linearities [2].
* Comparing Logistic Regression with Decision Tree, Logistic Regression generally works better for small data size, whereas Decision Tree tends to outperform as the data size grows. For categorical features, we generally need to use techniques such as one hot encoding to preprocess them.
* All features are numerical and there are only two class labels. Also, Logistic regression performs well if the data is linearly separable. Therefore, It is worthing trying Logistic regression as one of the initial models. 
    
**Xgboost, one of Kaggle’s top algorithms**
* In the recent years one algorithm emerged as favourite in the machine learning community, it is actually one of the most used in Kaggle: Xgboost.
* Here you can find an informative discussion on why that is the case: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-xgboost-given-so-much-less-attention-than-deep-learning-despite-its-ubiquity-in-winning-Kaggle-solutions
* The algorithm is not available sci-kit learn, here is how you can start working with it: http://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-first-xgboost-model-python-scikit-learn/

**How to choose the right model**

This is largely application dependent, but we can start with the two cheat sheets below for some general guidelines on how to choose the right model:

* http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-cheat-sheet

### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.
In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).
 - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.
 - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.
   - Record the total prediction time.
 - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.
 - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.
   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!


```python
# TODO: Import two metrics from sklearn - fbeta_score and accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score

def train_predict(learner, sample_size, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test): 
    '''
    inputs:
       - learner: the learning algorithm to be trained and predicted on
       - sample_size: the size of samples (number) to be drawn from training set
       - X_train: features training set
       - y_train: income training set
       - X_test: features testing set
       - y_test: income testing set
    '''
    
    # Create a map
    results = {}
    print sample_size
    # TODO: Fit the learner to the training data using slicing with 'sample_size' using .fit(training_features[:], training_labels[:])
    start = time() # Get start time
    learner = learner.fit(X_train[:sample_size], y_train[:sample_size])
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # TODO: Calculate the training time
    results['train_time'] = end - start
        
    # TODO: Get the predictions on the test set(X_test),
    #       then get predictions on the first 300 training samples(X_train) using .predict()
    start = time() # Get start time
    predictions_test = learner.predict(X_test)
    predictions_train = learner.predict(X_train[:300]) 
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # TODO: Calculate the total prediction time
    results['pred_time'] = end - start
            
    # TODO: Compute accuracy on the first 300 training samples which is y_train[:300]
    results['acc_train'] = accuracy_score(y_train[:300], predictions_train)
        
    # TODO: Compute accuracy on test set using accuracy_score()
    results['acc_test'] = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions_test)
    
    # TODO: Compute F-score on the the first 300 training samples using fbeta_score()
    results['f_train'] = fbeta_score(y_train[:300], predictions_train, beta=1)
        
    # TODO: Compute F-score on the test set which is y_test
    results['f_test'] = fbeta_score(y_test, predictions_test, beta=1)
       
    # Success
    print "{} trained on {} samples.".format(learner.__class__.__name__, sample_size)
        
    # Return the results
    return results
```

In addition to the F-score and computation time, we can also evaluate the models in more details using other sklearn functions, such as the confusion matrix and classification report. For example:
    
```python  
# confusion matrix example
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print cm

# classification report example
target_names = ['class 0', 'class 1', 'class 2']
cr = classification_report(y_true, y_pred, target_names=target_names)
print cr 
```

* http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-report

### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:
- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.
  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.
- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.

**Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!


```python
# TODO: Import the three supervised learning models from sklearn
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# TODO: Initialize the three models
# Here we are required to set the random_state of the models explicitly, 
# and we need to use the same random states for the algorithms with 
# default parameters and for the algorithm optimization via grid search later. 
# Using the same random states ensures that we can have a fair comparison 
# between the default and optimized algorithms.
clf_A = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 1)
clf_B = SVC(random_state = 1)
clf_C = LogisticRegression(random_state = 1)

# TODO: Calculate the number of samples for 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data
# HINT: samples_100 is the entire training set i.e. len(y_train)
# HINT: samples_10 is 10% of samples_100
# HINT: samples_1 is 1% of samples_100
samples_100 = int(len(y_train))
samples_10 = int(len(y_train) * 0.1)
samples_1 = int(len(y_train) * 0.01)
print samples_100
print samples_10
print samples_1
# Collect results on the learners
results = {}
for clf in [clf_A, clf_B, clf_C]:
    clf_name = clf.__class__.__name__
    results[clf_name] = {}
    for i, samples in enumerate([samples_1, samples_10, samples_100]):
        results[clf_name][i] = train_predict(clf, samples, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

# Run metrics visualization for the three supervised learning models chosen
vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)

## Improving Results
In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model

* Based on the evaluation you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models you believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000. 

** HINT: ** 
Look at the graph at the bottom left from the cell above(the visualization created by `vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)`) and check the F score for the testing set when 100% of the training set is used. Which model has the highest score? Your answer should include discussion of the:
* metrics - F score on the testing when 100% of the training data is used, 
* prediction/training time
* the algorithm's suitability for the data.

**Answer: **
* Quite surprisingly, among the three (untuned) models, logistic regression has the best performace both in F-score and prediction/training time.
    * As shown in the gragh at the second row and first column, logistic regression is much faster than the other two models when 100% traning data is used.
    * As shown in the graph at the second row and third column, logistic regression out-performs other two models in terms of F-score for all the three different training set sizes.
* However, Decision tree has competitive performance compared with logistic regression. It is quite obvious that the decision tree overfits the training data. It is possible that the decision tree outperformances logistic regression with certain hyperparameters get tuned or with more training data. Also, Decision Tree is more interpretable than Logistic Regression. I would say that the most appropriate model for the CharityML problem is Decision Tree.

### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms

* In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical jargon, such as describing equations.

** HINT: **

When explaining your model, if using external resources please include all citations.

**Answer: ** 
* The Decision tree model transforms the training data into a set of rules in form of a rooted tree. More specifically, A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node (including the root node) represents a "question" on a feature (e.g. whether a person is female or male), each branch represents the outcome of the question, and each leaf node represents a class label. The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.
* When making prediction on a test sample, we walk through the decision tree from the root to a leaf node by answering the question on a feature represented by each internal node on the way based on the value of that feature in the test sample. Finally, we reach a leaf node, the class label represented by which is the class we will assign to the test sample.

Both have very good discussion on decision trees.


### Implementation: Model Tuning
Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
 - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.
- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
 - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
 - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!
- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.

**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!


```python
# TODO: Import 'GridSearchCV', 'make_scorer', and any other necessary libraries

from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, make_scorer
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# TODO: Initialize the classifier
# clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# clf = LinearSVC()

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=1)
parameters = {'max_depth': [10, 50, 106], 'min_samples_split': [2, 6, 11]}


# TODO: Create the parameters list you wish to tune, using a dictionary if needed.
# HINT: parameters = {'parameter_1': [value1, value2], 'parameter_2': [value1, value2]}
#clf = LogisticRegression()
#parameters = {'C': [1, 10]}

# TODO: Make an fbeta_score scoring object using make_scorer()
scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta=0.5)

# TODO: Perform grid search on the classifier using 'scorer' as the scoring method using GridSearchCV()
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid=parameters, scoring=scorer)

# TODO: Fit the grid search object to the training data and find the optimal parameters using fit()
# It is noteworthy that here we are using the training set to tune the model, and keeping the test 
# set away to avoid data leakage. As a general guideline, we should never touch the test set during 
# model training and tuning, and should only use it for final model evaluation.
grid_fit = grid_obj.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the estimator
best_clf = grid_fit.best_estimator_

# Make predictions using the unoptimized and model
predictions = (clf.fit(X_train, y_train)).predict(X_test)
best_predictions = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Report the before-and-afterscores
print "Unoptimized model\n------"
print "Accuracy score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nOptimized Model\n------"
print "Final accuracy score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions))
print "Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))

### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation

* What is your optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? 
* Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? 
* How do the results from your optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks you found earlier in **Question 1**?_  

**Note:** Fill in the table below with your results, and then provide discussion in the **Answer** box.

#### Results:

|     Metric     | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
| Accuracy Score |     0.819         |      0.855      |
| F-score        |     0.627         |      0.719      |


**Answer: **
* The optimized model's accuracy is 0.855 and F-score is 0.720.
* The scores of optimized model is much better than those of unoptimized model.
* Since Naive Predictor's accuracy score is 0.2478 and F-score is 0.2917, we can see that the performance of optimized model is significantly better that that of Naive Predictor.

Although not the case here, it is possible that the tuned model does not significantly improve over untuned one, or it could even give worse result than untuned one. The first checkpoint is whether the list of tuning parameters includes the default parameters. Sometimes the default parameters can yield the best performance.

We may observe different results if we run the code with different random splits. This is largely due to the small and unbalanced dataset, and we can use techniques like StratifiedShuffleSplit to ensure that the ratio of the two classes are well maintained. For example:
    
from sklearn.cross_validation import StratifiedShuffleSplit

```python
...
ssscv = StratifiedShuffleSplit( y_train, n_iter=10, test_size=0.1)
grid = GridSearchCV(clf, parameters, cv = ssscv , scoring=f1_scorer) 
grid.fit( X_train, y_train ) 
... 
```

## Feature Importance

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.

Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?

**Answer:**
* The five most important features: 
    * occupation, 
    * age, 
    * education-num, 
    * capital-gain and 
    * hours-per-week (with importance in decreasing order)
        
* Occupation makes quite a difference in people's income. For example, Doctor, lawyer and software engineers typically learn much more than people of other professionals. Therefore, we would rank occupation the most important feature.
* Normally people with larger age would have higher income since they are more experienced and people with higer education-level also normally have higher income since they have more expertise. However, it is hard to tell which is more predicative than the other. We would rank the age and education-num the second and third place.
* People with higher Captial-gain means they have higher captial asset, which indicates that more income. 
* Hours-per-week means how much time a person work each week. At the same occupation, people work more hours typically learn more money. However, different occupation has quite different salary-per-hour, which means that people work more hours do not necessarily mean that they would learn more money when they have difference occupations. Threefor, I rank hours-per-week the fifth place. 

### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from the three used earlier.
 - Train the supervised model on the entire training set.
 - Extract the feature importances using `'.feature_importances_'`.


```python
# TODO: Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# TODO: Train the supervised model on the training set using .fit(X_train, y_train)
model = best_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# TODO: Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ 
importances = clf.feature_importances_

# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)
```

### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance

Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  
* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**?
* If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? 
* If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?

**Answer:**
* My answer (in Question 6) is quite close to result created by the visualization. But quite surprisingly, occupation is not in the result. By examining the occupation data closely, I think the reason that occupation is not listed in the top five most predictive features is that my assumption was not held in this particular training data set although it might be held in general case. 
* I did not think of married_civ_spouse as one of the top five features, let alone the most predictive feature. My guess is that people with married_civ_spouse are more likely to have stable jobs with decent income such that they are able to raise their family. 
* An alternative feature selection approach consists in leveraging the power of Recursive Feature Selection to automate the selection process and find a good indication of the number of relevant features (it is not suitable for this problem because that is not what is required by the project rubric, though it is generally a very good approach).

### Feature Selection
How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 


```python
# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print "Final Model trained on full data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, reduced_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5))
```

    Final Model trained on full data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8552
    F-score on testing data: 0.7189
    
    Final Model trained on reduced data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8457
    F-score on testing data: 0.6940


### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection

* How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?
* If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?

**Answer:**
* The performance (in terms of F-score and accuracy score) of the final model trained on reduced data is quite close to that of the final model trained by all features. More specifically, the accuracy score of the model trained on reduced data is slightly worse than that of the model trained on all features by 0.0098 while F-score is worse by 0.0258.
* Normally, I would not trade the accuracy or F-score for faster training time. However, if fast training speed is a critical requirement of the problem at hand such as the problem requires online training, using reduced data as training set that can achieve similar but slightly worse performance in terms of accuracy or F-score but can significantly reduce the training time is a wise choice. This is because In general, a model with the full feature set should outperform the model with reduced feature set, as more features contribute more information. However, in real life projects, we often have to balance computation time against the model performance. If the data size is large, it is a good idea to select important features to simplify the model.
